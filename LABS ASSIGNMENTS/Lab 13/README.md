# Lab 13: AI-Assisted Coding Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for various tasks as part of Lab 13 assignments. Each task demonstrates the use of AI-assisted coding techniques to improve code quality, readability, and performance.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Basic Calculator
- **File**: `Task 1.py`
- **Description**: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Features**:
  - Modular design using functions.
  - Dictionary-based mapping for operations.
- **Usage**: Run the script and follow the prompts to perform calculations.

### Task 2: Student Management System
- **File**: `Task 2.py`
- **Description**: A student management system implemented using object-oriented programming.
- **Features**:
  - Classes and methods for managing students.
  - Exception handling for invalid inputs.
- **Usage**: Run the script and interact with the menu to add, remove, view, or list students.

### Task 3: File Processing Optimization
- **File**: `Task 3.py`
- **Description**: Optimized file processing script for reading large log files.
- **Features**:
  - Uses generator expressions for efficiency.
  - Compares performance of legacy and optimized methods.
- **Usage**: Replace `large_log_file.txt` with the path to your log file and run the script.

### Task 4: Scientific Computation
- **File**: `Task 4.py`
- **Description**: Calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.
- **Features**:
  - Meaningful variable names and inline documentation.
  - Exception handling for invalid inputs.
- **Usage**: Run the script and input the radius of the circle when prompted.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script files.
3. Run the desired script using the command:
   ```
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.
